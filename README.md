Library management system is a project which aims in developing a web based
system to maintain all the daily work of library . Our System is a replacement for the ordinary library management systems which
depend on paper work for recording book ,desktop and usersâ€™ information. this
Library management System will provide an advanced book search mechanism and
will make it easy to borrow, insert and index a book in the library. Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the students as well as staff of
library to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human
efforts.
